# HTML Escape Codes

This is essentially a reference of UNICODE (UTF-8) HTML Escape Codes. It only contains the [basic multilingual plane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane) of unicode (the first 65,535 codes). The other planes are more specific to CJK (Chinese Japanese Korean) ideographs, which I don't use. Please feel free to do whatever you want. I just put this here because the other tables I find online are "not complete enough" for me :)
